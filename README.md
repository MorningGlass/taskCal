## Roadmap

- [x] Hide time on all day events, and use a different (maybe grey) calendar icon   
- [x] Try larger icon
- [x] Move completed tasks to bottom of list  
- [x] Show tags? (not sure about this)  
- [x] dark mode toggle... 
- [ ] iOS app
- [x] Make Calendar events "doable" - fade and score out like tasks on right click with "Mark as complete" DONE
- [x] Double clicking on task opens reminders app at that task or calendar at that entry?
- [x] Narrow window
- [x] doubleclick  taskbar title  to return to today
- [x] Tasks with no time set should say so, rather than 00:00
